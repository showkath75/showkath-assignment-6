1.)Why we use loops?
Ans) Loops are important in Python or in any other programming language as they help you to execute a block of code repeatedly.
2) what is while loop?
ans) Python while loop is used to run a block code until a certain condition is met. The syntax of while loop is: while condition: # body of while loop. 
Here, A while loop evaluates the condition. If the condition evaluates to True , the code inside the while loop is executed.
3) what is iterator in loop?
Ans) In Python, an iterator is an object that allows you to iterate over collections of data, such as lists, tuples, dictionaries, and sets. 
Python iterators implement the iterator design pattern, which allows you to traverse a container and access its elements.
4) what is increment in loop?
Ans) In Python += is used for incrementing, and -= for decrementing. In some other languages, there is even a special syntax ++ and -- for incrementing or decrementing by 1. 
Python does not have such a special syntax. To increment x by 1 you have to write x += 1 or x = x + 1 . 
5) why we use range function?
Ans) Necessity to Use Range() Function in Python:
Whenever an action needs to be performed a certain number of times, then you must make use of range in Python to generate a sequence of numbers within a given range.
 The range() function is used in loops like for loop, while loop etc. to iterate through the sequences.
